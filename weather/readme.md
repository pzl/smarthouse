Weather Submodule
=================

Displays NOAA weather data


Configuration
-------------

Copy `coords_default.py` to `coords.py` and input your own latitute and longitude.
If you don't know and don't know how to get your coordinates, one quick way is to open [maps.google.com](http://maps.google.com), navigate to the place you need coordinates for, and then right-click and select "What's here?". Coordinates should appear somewhere on screen (at the time of writing, this is at the top left under the search bar) but also in the URL. Use these at lat and lon, respectively.

The default coordinates are somewhere in California
